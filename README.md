Hey there, I'm an aspiring programmer in the U.S.A. I know some web programming (HTML/CSS/JS and such) and miscellaneous other languages but I mainly code with Python. In my opinion, Python is one of the most powerful programming languages. I'm also learning XML for .SVG files (vector images).

### My interests

I interested in coding, music composition and graphic design (kind of). Outside of programming, I enjoy learning physics, calculus, and reading and writing books.
