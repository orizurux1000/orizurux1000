- 👋 Hi, I’m @orizurux1000. I mostly use this account for CS50 (see below); in the future I may use it for web/etc. developing.
- 🌱 I've taken multiple CS50 courses; I use Python and Javascript as well as HTML/CSS for developing.
- 🎵 I use MuseScore4 for composing music and occasionally post bugs/glitches here.
- 📫 I'm on Replit with the same username; I don't use it much though.
- 🙏 Thank you for visiting my profile. _triunk_
