- 👋 Hi, I’m @orizurux1000.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming, and have learned HTML, CSS, JS, and am learning Ruby. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning processing javascript on Khan Academy, and taking Harvard's Understanding Technology course (CS50T).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now. I don't use GitHub for collaborating but just programming. 
- 📫 How to reach me - @senbazuru on Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/senbazuru), @orizuru on Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/orizuru), @The Oh on Edx and Ed, @theotheelectroflute@gmail.com (email).
